!!!WIP!!!
Project done in my free time to explore API's and machine learning. Aim of the project is to create a data analysis tool to calculate the best character to select in the videogame "League of Legends", based on data collected from the Riot Games API.
Currently put the project on ice as part time job + other schoolwork is top priority.
